# FSDLab-1
This repository contains the Full Stack Development (FSD) lab experiments that I completed as part of my coursework.
It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises demonstrating concepts like:
=> DOM manipulation
=> JavaScript functions and events
=> Conditional statements and loops
=> Form validation
=> CSS styling and box model
All experiments have separate HTML and JS files, and are ready to run in a browser.
